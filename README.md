This is a project for *Computer Graphics 2022* course on Computer Science course. Starting this project there were defined crutial functionalities that needed to be implemented into the code, they are:
- Adding, editing and deleting a polygon
- For editing:
  - Moving a point
  - Deleting a point
  - Adding a new point in the middle of an edge
  - Moving an edge
  - Moving a polygon
- Adding special contraints call 'Relations', they are:
  - Keeping two edges parallel
  - Keeping set edge a set length
- Deleting a relation
- Displaying an icoon above an edge with 'Relation'
- Implementing two diffrent alghoritms for drawing straight line
  1. Bresenham's line algorithm
  2. Default line drawing alghoritm

## Usage
This program operates in couple of modes, that user can select by clicking with RMB on drawing area and selecting desired mode from context menu.

Modes are:
- Adding a point
- Moving a point
- Moving an edge
- Moving a polygon
- Deleting a point
- Adding relation
  - Adding fixed length relation
  - Adding parallelism relation
User can manipulate polygons in each of this modes. Apart from that, user can also choose in contex menu which algoritm of drawing line to use.
